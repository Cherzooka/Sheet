    A Golaen sea god, and their primary god of worship, said to dwell on the
    bottom of the sea, she is believed to guide the dead to their new lives. 
    Offerings are often given to her before and during sea voyages, as a way 
    of informing her that the ship does not contain souls bound for the next 
    life. Some ancient legends believe her to originally be a queen of Golae 
    Sang-eo, reborn as the large serpentine sea dragon that now claims the 
    seas. <br><br>
    
    She's generally described as a Quiet and Uncaring goddess in many regards,
    Keulaxen is not known for communicating heavily with the people who believe
    in her, must less making her opinions known to them. Despite her heavy
    association with death, she is not regarded as a violent or cruel god,
    merely one bound to her duty and role in the cycle of life. <br><br>
    
    In Golae Sang-eo, there is always a high priestess, 
    chosen at the age of nine, who is ritually married to the Goddess, and spends
    her life speaking for the largely silent sea goddess. When this priestess
    passes away, she is said to reborn as part of Keulaxen. <br><br>
    
    When one dies in Golae Sang-eo, their bones are bleached and carved with the
    tales and accomplishments in their life, then cast into the sea on burial 
    ships to be consumed by Keulaxen. She devours the ship and the bones it carries,
    and uses the carving on the whitened bone to judge the deceased, and help in
    her decision on where to lead the soul for it's next life.
