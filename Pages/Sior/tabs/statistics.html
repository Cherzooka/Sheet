        <h3>Druidic Circle of the Arctic</h3>
        <p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
        ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids
        meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal
        secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief 
        priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors 
        to the rulers of those folks. As a member of this circle, your magic is
        influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's
        mysterious rites.</p><br>
        
        <b>Druidic</b>
        <p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the 
        language and use it to leavehidden messages. You and others who know 
        this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the 
        message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check 
        but can't decipher it without magic.</p>
        
        <b>Spellcasting</b>
        <p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells 
        to shape that essence to your will.</p> <br>
        
        <p>To cast a druid spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level 
        or higher. You regain all spell slots when you finish a long rest. You 
        prepare a list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, 
        choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of
        druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level. The 
        spells spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a 
        long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in
        prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
        on your list.</p> <br>
        
        <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your
        magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your 
        wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In 
        addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw 
        DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
        
        <i>Spell Save DC: <span title="8 + 2 (Proficiency Bonus) + 3 (Wis Modififer)">13</span></i>
        <i>Spell Attack Modifier: <span title="2 (Proficiency Bonus) + 3 (Wis Modifier)">5</span></i>
        
        <span>
          <span><b>Ritual Casting</b>
          <p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
          ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p></span>
          
          <span><b>Spellcasting Focus</b>
          <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your 
          druid spells.</p></span>

        <h3>Researcher</h3>
        <p>When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not 
        know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain
        it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, 
        university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might
        rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost 
        inaccessible place, or that it simple cannot be found. Unearthing the 
        deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a 
        whole campaign.</p>

        <h3>Healer</h3>
        <p>You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and
        get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><span>When you use a healer's kit to stabilize a dying creature, 
          that creature also regains 1 hit point.</span></li>
          <li><span>As an action, you can spend one use of a healer's kit to 
          tend to a creature and restore 1d6+4 hit points to it, plus additional 
          hit points equal to the creature's maximum number of hit dice. The 
          creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until it 
          finishes a short or long rest.</span></li>
