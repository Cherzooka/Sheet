      <p>Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following 
      effects within range: <br><br>

      — You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what 
        the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect
        might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, 
        falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 
        round.<br><br>
        
      — You instantly make a flower bloom, a seed pod open, or a 
        leaf bud bloom.<br><br>

      — You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as
        falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the 
        faint order of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.<br><br>
        
      — You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a
        small campfire.

      <p>A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for 
      the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds
      bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
      The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.
      <br><br>

      You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When
      you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the 
      flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. 
      On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. <br><br>

      This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 
      11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

      <p>Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green,
      or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is
      cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For
      the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot 
      radius.<br><br>

      Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if 
      the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit
      from being invisible.</p>

      <p>A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your
      spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or
      constructs. <br><br>

      At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd 
      level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 
      1st.</p>

      <p>For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you.
      If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint 
      aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic,
      and you learn its school of magic, if any. <br><br>

      The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of 
      stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or 
      dirt.</p>
