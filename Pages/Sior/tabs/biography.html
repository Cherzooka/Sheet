        <b> Mother </b>
        <p>A Hitoic woman raised in the Kaldrfjǫll city of Síldvik, who moved 
        to Fégård to live with her husband. She primarily supports the family 
        through her wood carving. While quiet and shy, she's a remarkably
        stubborn woman. Growing up, Siôrus was closer with her than Shae ever
        was. </p>
