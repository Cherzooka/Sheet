        <h3>Bardic College of Valor</h3>
        <p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep 
        alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a 
        new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around 
        great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present.
        They travel the land to witness greatevents firsthand and to ensure 
        that the memory of those events doesn't pass the world. With their 
        songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishmen 
        as the heroes of old. </p>
        
        <b>Spellcasting</b>
        <p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in 
        harmony with your wishes and magic. Your spells are part of your vast 
        repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.</p>
        
        <i>Spell Save DC: <span title="8 + 3 (Proficiency Bonus) + 2 (Cha Modififer)">13</span></i>
        <i>Spell Attack Modifier: <span title="3 (Proficiency Bonus) + 2 (Cha Modifier)">5</span></i>
        
        <span><span><b>Ritual Casting</b>
        <p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has 
        the ritual tag.</p></span>
        
        <span><b>Spellcasting Focus</b>
        <p>You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your 
        bard spells.</p></span></span>
        
        <b>Bardic Inspiration</b>
        <p>You can inspire other through stirring words or music. To do so, you 
        use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than
        yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains 
        one Bardic Inspiration die. <br><br>

        Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add
        the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it 
        makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before 
        deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
        DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration
        die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
        Inspiration die at a time. <br><br>

        You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma 
        modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you 
        finish a long rest.</p>
        
        <i>Number of uses: <span title="Cha Modifier">2</span></i>
        <i>Bardic Inspiration die: <span>d6</span></i>
        
        <span><span><b>Jack of all Trades</b>
        <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, 
        rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already 
        include your proficiency bonus.</p></span>
        
        <span><b>Expertise</b>
        <p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your 
        proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability checks you make that uses
        either of the chosen proficiencies. (Performance, Animal Handling)</p></span>
        
        <span><b>Bonus Proficiencies</b>
        <p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain 
        proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. </p>
        </span></span>
        
        <b>Song of Rest</b>
        <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to 
        help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any 
        friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at 
        the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of 
        those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>
        
        <b>Combat Inspiration</b>
        <p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature
        that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add 
        the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively,
        when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its 
        reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled 
        to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing
        whether it hits or misses.</p>

      <div class="trait">
        <h3>Battlemaster</h3>
        <p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial 
        techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat 
        is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such
        as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the 
        lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the 
        Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of 
        great skill and knowledge.</p>
        
        <span>
          <span>
            <b>Dueling Fighting Style</b>
            <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other 
            weapons, you gain +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
          </span>
          
          <span>
            <b>Student of War</b>
            <p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisans' 
            tools of your choice.</p>
          </span>
          
          <span>
            <b>Second Wind</b>
            <p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to 
            protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus 
            action to regain hit points equal to 1d10+ your fighter level. Once 
            you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before 
            you can use it again.</p>
          </span>
          
          <span>
            <b>Action Surge</b>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal
            limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional 
            action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
            Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest 
            before you can use it again.</p>
          </span>
        </span>
        
        <b>Combat Superiority</b>
        <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers 
        that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. You learn three
        maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. 
        You can use only one maneuver per attack. You have four superiority 
        dice, which are d8s. A superiority dice is expended when you use it. 
        You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short
        or long rest. Some of your maneuvers require your target make a saving
        throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is 
        calculated as follows:</p>
        
        <i>Maneuver save DC: <span title="8 + 3 (Proficiency Bonus) + 3 (Str Modifier)">14</span></i>
        
        <span>
          <span>
            <b>Parry</b>
            <p>When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can 
            use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the 
            damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your 
            Dexterity modifier.</p>
          </span>
          
          <span>
            <b>Riposte</b>
            <p>When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your 
            reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon 
            attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority 
            die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
          </span>
          
          <span><b>Disarming Strike</b>
          <p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one 
          superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop 
          one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority 
          die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength 
          saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you chose. The 
          object lands at its feet.</p></span>

        <h3>By Popular Demand</h3>
        <p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern
        but possibly with a circus, at a theatre, or even in a noble's court.
        At such a place, you recieve free lodging and food at a modest or 
        comfortable standard (Depending on the quality of the establishment), 
        as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes
        you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you, they

        You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning
