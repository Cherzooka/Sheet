      <p>You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a 
      creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it 
      need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take
      1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes
      before the end of its next turn. <br><br>

      This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th
      level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

      <p>You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. 
      Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius 
      and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you 
      like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the 
      light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.
      <br><br>

      If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature
      must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.</p>

      <p>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts
      for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited 
      by their intelligence, but at a minimum, beasts can give you information
      about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive
      or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a 
      beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM’s discretion.</p>

      <p>A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit 
      points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has
      no effect on undead or constructs. <br><br>

      When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the

      <p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a 
      door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that 
      contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access. <br><br>
      
      A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred 
      becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks,
      only one of them is unlocked. <br><br>
      
      If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is 
      suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and
      shut normally. <br><br>
      
      When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 
      feet, emanates from the target object.</p>

      <p>For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 
      20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any
